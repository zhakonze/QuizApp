================ ALC 7 Days of Code Challenge ==============

The Goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about any topic. 

Requirements:

* App contains 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.
* Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
        - Checkboxes are only used for questions with multiple right answers. 
        - Radio buttons are only used for questions with a single right answer.
* App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.
* The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
        - Text sizes are defined in sp
        - Lengths are defined in dp
        - Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
* The app includes at least four of the following Views: 
        TextView, 
        ImageView, 
        Button, 
        Checkbox, 
        EditText, 
        LinearLayout, 
        RelativeLayout, 
        ScrollView, 
        RadioButton, 
        RadioGroup.
        - If applicable, the app uses nested ViewGroups to reduce the complexity of the layout.
* The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated. 
Either by updating the layout, adding a scrollable feature or some other mechanism that adheres to Android development guidelines.
